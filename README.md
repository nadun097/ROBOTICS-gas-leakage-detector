//Introduction

Sri Lanka has lost many properties and even lives due to the leaking of gas and consequent explosions. As this problem is very important for such countries, we tend to solve this by developing a prototype of Gas Leakage Protection System automation to minimize those kinds of risks. It will provide safety for residential places in terms of real-time monitoring, early detection, and quick response activities. It has a gas-leak sensor, an automatic gas shut-off, and alert systems with alarms and SMS messages. To make it even better, our system will also have: 

•	Automatically open windows to disperse leaked gas 
•	Integrate a standalone dashboard to provide real-time data visualization and manual control options for the user. 
 
 
//Problem Statement 
 
Gas leakage accidents have been one of the major safety concerns in causing severe damage to property, injury, and even death. In Sri Lanka, there has been an increase in such accidents, and the need for an efficient and reliable gas leakage detection and prevention system is felt strongly. Traditional solutions, including manual shutoff valves and basic alarms, are usually inadequate in responding appropriately and in a timely manner to such emergencies.


//Importance of Solving the Problem

A gas leak can be very harmful to people and property. They may ignite, causing explosions, fires, or even death. Solving this problem is not about just making things safer; it's also about using technology to stop disasters before they happen. By fixing this problem, we make sure:

•	Enhanced Safety: Real-time detection and automated responses significantly reduce the risk of explosions and fires, safeguarding lives and assets.
•	Proactive Mitigation: Automatic window control  provide secondary safety measures, offering a comprehensive approach to minimizing risks
•	Increased Awareness: The integration of a standalone dashboard educates users by providing real-time data, empowering them to take informed
